# 🎬 MovieFlix – Netflix Landing Page Clone

MovieFlix is a responsive front-end clone of Netflix's landing page that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal with this project was to recreate Netflix's signature look and feel — including its dark theme, bold visuals, and smooth interactions — while strengthening my front-end development and responsive design skills.

## 📖 Overview

This project replicates the visual design and user experience of Netflix's homepage. It includes interactive sections such as:

- A hero banner with an email signup form
- A trending movies carousel
- A feature highlights grid
- A FAQ accordion

All built from scratch using semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## ⚙️ Features I Implemented

### 🎥 Hero Section

- Netflix-style layout with logo and sign-in button
- Full-width background banner with overlay
- Email signup form and CTA buttons styled in Netflix red

### 🔥 Trending Now Section

- Horizontally scrollable gallery showcasing top 10 trending titles
- Smooth scroll animations using JavaScript
- Hover zoom effects on movie posters
- Numbered rankings on posters
- Responsive behavior that hides arrows on smaller screens

### 💡 More Reasons to Join

- Four feature cards highlighting Netflix's main benefits (watch anywhere, download, etc.)
- Gradient backgrounds and icon illustrations
- Responsive grid layout for all screen sizes

### ❓ FAQ Section

- Fully interactive accordion built with vanilla JavaScript
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Icon switching between "+" and "x" states

### 🦶 Footer

- Organized multi-column layout with common navigation links
- Contact info and responsive grid structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible structure
- **CSS3** – Custom animations, gradients, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Handles interactivity and animations
- **Bootstrap CSS** – Used selectively for grid and utility classes

## 📱 Responsiveness

I designed MovieFlix using a mobile-first approach, ensuring smooth adaptation across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Layouts, text sizes, and interactions adjust dynamically for each viewport.

## 💻 JavaScript Functionality I Built

- **Carousel Controls**: Left/right arrows scroll the trending movie list smoothly
- **FAQ Accordion**: Toggles question visibility with animated icon changes
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added subtle fade and scale effects for a polished UI

## 🎯 What I Focused On

- Achieving pixel-perfect alignment with Netflix's official design
- Writing clean, semantic, and maintainable code
- Enhancing UX with subtle animations
- Ensuring responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility
- Strengthening my CSS layout and DOM manipulation skills

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add user login and video playback functionality
- Implement search and user profiles
- Expand to include movie detail pages

## 📝 Notes
